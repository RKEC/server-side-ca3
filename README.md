#### By Richard Collins D00230925

## About the project
The application is made to emmulate a phone shop, which you can add, delete and edit phones and their operating systems. 
You can also calculate the monthly bill pay cost. This is done by clicking the buy button beside a phone. You will be directed to a new page with options for payback period and initial payment.
This will give you a price for which you have to pay a month for the specified amount of time.
In this new version, you can register an account, login and contact me. Also an admin page was added.
